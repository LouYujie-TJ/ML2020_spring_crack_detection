We choosed another paper which is higher in pr and other scores than the last paper as our goal.

This teamwork is based on the paper:"Feature Pyramid and Hierarchical Boosting Network for Pavement Crack Detection"

We want do achieve the algorithm by PyTorch and then strengthen the model to get a higher score.
